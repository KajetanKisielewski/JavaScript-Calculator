## Overview

### The challenge

The task was to create a basic calculator with the following options : addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), power(^).
The task was to be performed using an if statement and a loop.
Communication with the user was to take place via prompt box.

### How it's works

To use this calculator, you have to follow the directions shown in prompt box.
In the first step, you need to indicate the operation you want to perform by typing the appropriate symbol(+, -, *, /, ^).
In the second and third step you need to typing a finite number.
The application allows you to view the current and previous calculations
